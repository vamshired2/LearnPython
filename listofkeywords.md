Here are some important Python keywords:

and: It is a logical operator that returns True if both operands are true.

or: It is a logical operator that returns True if at least one of the operands is true.

not: It is a logical operator that returns the opposite of the operand's truth value.

if: It is used to start a conditional statement and is followed by a condition that determines whether the code block is executed.

else: It is used in conjunction with if to define an alternative code block to execute when the if condition is False.

elif: Short for "else if," it is used to check additional conditions after an if statement and is used in combination with if and else.

while: It is used to create a loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

for: It is used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

in: Used with for, it checks if a value is present in a sequence.

try: It is the beginning of a block of code that is subject to exception handling. It is followed by except to catch and handle exceptions.

except: Used with try, it defines a block of code to execute when an exception is raised in the corresponding try block.

finally: Used with try, it defines a block of code that is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not.

def: It is used to define a function in Python.

return: It is used within a function to specify the value that the function should return.

class: It is used to define a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming.

import: It is used to import modules or libraries to access their functions, classes, or variables.

from: Used with import to specify which specific components from a module should be imported.

as: Used with import to create an alias for a module, making it easier to reference in the code.

True: It represents a boolean value for "true."

False: It represents a boolean value for "false."

None: It represents a special null value or absence of value.

is: It is used for identity comparison, checking if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

lambda: It is used to create small, anonymous functions (lambda functions).

with: It is used for context management, ensuring that certain operations are performed before and after a block of code.

global: It is used to declare a global variable within a function's scope.

nonlocal: It is used to declare a variable as nonlocal, which allows modifying a variable in an enclosing (but non-global) scope.
